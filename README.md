A feature store is a data management system that manages and serves features to machine learning models

Data Scientists spend an inordinate amount of time transforming data before they can start building models.

What’s worse, when they start a new use case, they often find there is no clean data to use.

Notebook-based data science can make it difficult to track and manage the data that is being used. And, it’s less clear how to take work done into a notebook and transform that into a production job.

People on the data team who are not data scientists have close to a zero chance of accomplishing anything with the ML tools at their disposal.

Online and offline requirements for data lack a unifying data layer.

Is a feature store just a database?

A feature store is a data warehouse of features for machine learning. Differently from a data warehouse, it is dual-database: one serving features at low latency to online applications and another storing large volumes of features.
